:wave: Hello! I'm Sophie (aka Stern Bert). I'm using this site as an experiment in personal note-taking, knowledge management self-development.

I'm interested in learning about creativity, tools for thought and design. We'll see what other seeds sprout from this digital garden!  :seedling:

I have zero coding or web development knowledge, so I'm very grateful for the template created by Maxime Vaillancourt to create this site.
