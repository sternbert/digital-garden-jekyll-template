Hello! I'm Sophie (aka Stern Bert). I'm using this site as an experiment in personal note-taking, knowledge management self-development.

I'm interested in learning about creativity, tools for thought and design. We'll see what other seeds sprout from this digital garden!  ðŸŒ±

I have zero coding or web development knowledge, so I'm very grateful for the template by Maxime Vaillancourt, [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template).
