# Dunning-Kruger effect
The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias where incompetent people have an inflated sense of their abilities. Conversely, highly-skilled people often have a decreased sense of their own ability (because of a perception that if they find a particular task easy, other people must too). 

This happens because if you are incompetent, you often don't have knowledge about the relevant activity's standards of performance (although compare to [[The taste gap]], where you can be defeated by the knowledge of your own incompetence).

Essentially, this boils down ignorance about one's own ignorance. The effect of this is that:
* inaccurate / incomplete / misguided knowledge leads people to make mistakes
* those same knowledge deficits prevent people from knowing they are making mistakes
