# When presenting your view, balance advocacy and inquiry

Make thinking **explicit** and subject to **public examination**. This creates an atmosphere of genuine vulnerability.
### Guidelines to balancing advocacy and inquiry
When advocating your view:
* Make your own reasoning explicit (i.e. say how you arrived at your view and the data upon which it is based)
* Encourage others to explore your view (e.g. ***Do you see any gaps in my reasoning?***) 
* Encourage others to provide different views (i.e. ***Do you have either different data or different conclusions, or both?***)
* Actively inquire into others’ views that different from your own (i.e. ***What are your views? How did you arrive at your view?***)

When inquiring into others’ views:
* If you are making assumptions about others’ views, state your assumptions clearly and acknowledge you are making assumptions
* State the data upon which your assumptions are based
* Don’t bother asking questions if you’re not genuinely interested in the others’ response
When you arrive at an impasse:
* Ask what data or logic might change their views
* Ask if there is any way you might together design an experiment (or some other inquiry) that might provide new information
