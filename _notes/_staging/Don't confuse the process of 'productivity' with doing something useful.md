# Don't confuse the process of 'productivity' with doing something useful
It's easy to confuse writing, thinking or implementing systems of productivity with actually *being* productive. 'Better productivity' isn't the point - the point is what your productivity is directed towards. As Jenny Odell says: 
>... productive for what purpose, and for whom? 

So instead of endlessly researching the best note-taking app / how to be more productive / how to build a second brain, instead consider how that time could be used to really think about or learn something.

["Better note-taking" misses the point; what matters is better thinking](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z7kEFe6NfUSgtaDuUjST1oczKKzQQeQWk4Dbc) - 
>Lots of people write about solutions to the problem that [Note-writing practices are generally ineffective](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8V2q398qu89vdJ73N2BEYCgevMqux3yxQUAC). The vast majority of that writing fixates on a myopic, “lifehacking”-type frame, focused on answering questions like: “how should I organize my notes?”, “what kind of journal should I use?”, “how can I make it easy to capture snippets of things I read?”, etc.
>
>Answers to these questions are unsatisfying because the questions are focused on the wrong thing. The goal is not to take notes—the goal is to think effectively. Better questions are “what practices can help me reliably develop insights over time?”, “how can I shepherd my attention effectively?” etc.
