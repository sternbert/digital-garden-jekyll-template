# Foundations of a strong vision
-   A strong vision incorporates both long-term values and goals, as well as shorter-term goals
-   Questions to ask:
    -   What sort of person would I like to become?
    -   What are my areas of interest?
    -   Why are those areas interesting?
    -   How am I going to achieve competence in those areas?
    -   How am I going to continue growing and expanding my horizons?
    -   What short-term steps will I take to to achieve those goals?
    -   How will I balance the long-term goals with the short-term realities of the situation I find myself in?
### Remember:
* A vision isn’t instant. You need to work at it, put time aside for the process, and learn to integrate it into your everyday life.
* A good vision isn’t inflexible. **It’s something that gets changed as you go along, never lightly, but frequently.** This is especially important when considering that [[Ambition is inherently limited to what we can presently imagine]].
