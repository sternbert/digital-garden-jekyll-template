# Learning CSS
## Font family
* The **font-family** property specifies the font for an element.
* The **font-family** property can hold several font names as a "fallback" system. If the browser does not support the first font, it tries the next font.
* There are two types of font family names:
	* **family-name** - The name of a font-family, like "times", "courier", "arial", etc.
	* **generic-family** - The name of a generic-family, like "serif", "sans-serif", "cursive", "fantasy", "monospace".
* Start with the font you want, and always end with a generic family, to let the browser pick a similar font in the generic family, if no other fonts are available.
* Separate each value with a comma.
* If a font name contains white-space, it must be quoted. 
* Single quotes must be used when using the "style" attribute in HTML.
## Lists
* In HTML, there are two main types of lists:
	* unordered lists ``<ul>`` - the list items are marked with bullets
	* ordered lists ``<ol>`` - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
## Letter spacing
* **letter-spacing: normal** - The spacing between the characters is **normal**.
* **letter-spacing: 2px** You can use **pixel** values.
* **letter-spacing: 0.1em** You can use **em** values: this allows the spacing to remain _relative_ to the font-size.
