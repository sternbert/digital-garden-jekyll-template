# Even the best job won't be enjoyable all the time

Even the best job won’t be ‘enjoyable’ all the time. It's especially challenging when starting in a new job and to expose yourself to feeling vulnerable and possibly looking stupid. 

The challenge means that you are learning and pushing through to the next level. **Don’t equate difficulty with thinking the job isn’t right for you.** 

Also, don't think that there is some 'magic' job out there which you will love all of the time. Every job has bullshit, admin and bureaucracy.  ^b5ac28

It's a natural extension of the approach to [[Make decisions based on what will ‘enlarge’ us over what makes us happy]].

> *Even the best jobs are only good seventy percent of the time:* If you have a great job you will find yourself questioning three days out of ten what you are doing, why you are doing it and if you are any good. The reasons for this are three-fold. First, do recognize that you are being paid for what you do and the more you are paid the harder the job is and the problems and troubles you must deal with. Often the challenges or the situations or the people you have to deal with require you to steel yourself with increased resolve. Second, if you have a great job it is one that is growing you and sometimes throws you challenges that require you to build new muscles and do new things. ***Learning is never easy and if you are growing there will be days that the pain will feel more like a signal that you dislike your job rather than you are building new expertise. The best jobs have flow which is a combination of competence and challenge and sometimes the challenge can be quite daunting.*** Finally, we are all living in a time of great change, chaos and velocity which is filled with uncertainty. The most relevant and most transformative industries are in the eye of the storm and this can make a day at work feel like a day in the high-speed spin cycle of a laundry machine. And with today’s health, economic and social challenges, one often longs for a pause or rewind button.
