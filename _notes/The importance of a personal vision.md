# The importance of a personal vision
A personal vision gives life a sense of purpose, direction and excitement. A personal vision gives you a consistent point to direct your psychic energies towards, informing both long and short-term goals. It elevates everyday actions into something more ambitious and exciting, placing these actions in the context of a larger, coherent whole.
