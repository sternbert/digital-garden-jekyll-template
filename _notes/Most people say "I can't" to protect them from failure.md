# Most people say "I can't" to protect them from failure

Most people pre-emptively lower their expectations to protect them from failure. 
By saying "I can't *(draw, write, code)*", it shields people from trying to do the work required, and the subsequent mistakes and failure that comes with the work. It is a statement of intention rather than fact: "I can't" means "I'm not going to try."

> ... if you asked random people on the street if they'd like to be able to draw like Leonardo, you'd find most would say something like "Oh, I can't draw." **This is more a statement of intention than fact; it means, I'm not going to try.** Because the fact is, if you took a random person off the street and somehow got them to work as hard as they possibly could at drawing for the next twenty years, they'd get surprisingly far. But it would require a great moral effort; it would mean staring failure in the eye every day for years. And so to protect themselves people say "I can't." \- Paul Graham
