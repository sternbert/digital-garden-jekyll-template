title: It might not be physical rest that you need when you feel tired and depleted
---

You may not be physically tired; you may be drained in other areas of your life that makes you feel lethargic, unmotivated or generally 👎. As it’s not physical tiredness, physical rest on its own isn’t the answer. 

[Saundra Dalton-Smith](https://ideas.ted.com/the-7-types-of-rest-that-every-person-needs/) talks about seven types of rest:
1. Physical 💪
2. Social 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
3. Emotional 💞
4. Mental 🧠
5. Creative 🎨
6. Spiritual 🧘‍♀️
7. Sensory 👃

These are helpful lenses to think about different areas of my life. However, I prefer to think of these in terms of ‘buckets’ rather than ‘rest’. This enables me to consider the inputs into each of these areas, and in particular whether those inputs are restorative, energising and positive, or whether they are actually causing the bucket to overflow or drain. For example, for the physical bucket it might not be passive rest that’s needed to fill the bucket, but instead more activity and movement. Conversely, for the mental bucket, as I’ve just started a new job, it might be that I’ve reached the limit of what my mental bucket can take - what’s needed is a healthy outlet, like meditation, journalling or a [good fiction book](/reading){: .internal-link} that can help ease my mental load. 

When assessing my buckets, some things to think about are: 
* How do I maintain the ideal level of each bucket? (e.g. for the physical bucket: what’s my ideal amount of sleep? How much movement each day / week makes me feel good?)
* What are the most important buckets to fill? (e.g. I feel empty if I don’t have some sort of creative input in my life, whether that’s reading a good book, seeing a movie or show, or working on a side project)
* Which buckets do I tend to neglect and require more conscious input? (e.g. as an introvert, I can sometimes overlook the importance of the social bucket, but I always feel better after high quality interactions with close friends)
* Which buckets feel like they are overflowing and need to be drained? (e.g. I’ve started a new job and my mind is working overtime. I need to think about how to build mental rest into my day. The Pomodoro technique is good during the workday, as well as allowing plenty of time to wind down in the evening)
* Which buckets are empty or running low?
* What is draining the buckets? Is there a way I can stop or reduce the drain?

## Filling the buckets 🪣 🪣 🪣

#### Physical bucket 💪
* Fill - walks, yoga, running, sleep, naps, gentle stretching, massage 
* Drains - poor sleep, sitting all day, not getting outside 

#### Social 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
* Fill - 1:1 / small group catch ups (especially without kids!), date nights
* Drains - large gatherings

#### Mental 🧠
* Fill - good quality consumption of books / podcasts / articles, [learning something new](/learning){: .internal-link}, note-taking, visiting the library or a bookstore, meditation, journalling, Pomodoro technique 
* Drains - news overconsumption, constant noise / stimulation (not every walk / car trip needs to be accompanied by a podcast or audiobook!)

#### Creative 🎨
* Fill - [[digital garden]], [[reading]] great books, going to the movies, watching (some) YouTubers, writing
																	
#### Spiritual 🧘‍♀️
* Fill - Shabbat, mediation, walking in nature 

#### Emotional 💞
* Fill - open conversations, having a project or hobby that gives a [sense of purpose and direction](/vision){: .internal-link}

#### Sensory 👃
* Fill - time in nature, massage / facial, 
* Drain - bright lights, noise (particularly too much kids’ music!), screen time (especially before bed) 			

### Note
The above is likely to change as I reflect on it more and refine it. I’m not sure the bucket metaphor quite works, but I want a way to think about what influences each area in a positive way (i.e. active steps I can take), as well as being conscious of what could feel depleting or draining. The emotional bucket also feels quite under-sketched, as well as the spiritual, but perhaps that’s a sign that they are the areas I need to work on the most!
