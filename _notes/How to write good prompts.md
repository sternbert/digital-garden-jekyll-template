# How to write good prompts
* Set an accessible goal by aiming to write a small number of key prompts (say 5 - 10)
* On the first read, write prompts about whatever seems most important, meaningful or useful 
* For simple material, you can write the prompts as you read
* For more challenging material, highlight or note the important details, and then write prompts as a batch at the end
* For tougher topics, focus on prompts about basic details you can build on - raw facts, terms
