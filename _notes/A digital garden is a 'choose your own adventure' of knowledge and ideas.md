# A digital garden is a 'choose your own adventure' of knowledge and ideas

I think of digital gardens as akin to a [‘choose your own adventure’](http://interconnected.org/home/2021/03/08/zeitgeist) of knowledge and ideas. Instead of reading chronologically or in a pre-defined order, a digital garden invites interaction and exploration by the user, and different journeys and destinations with each use. 

Digital gardens seem to live quite harmoniously with the [[Zettelkasten]] system of note-taking and personal knowledge management, built on atomic notes with interconnections, rather than polished articles arranged chronologically or only relevant at a certain point in time.

Like a physical garden, the components of a thriving digital garden are alive: each seed / note / idea constantly grows and evolves. That could be through the gardener tending to it, or through the seeds intermingling  and sprouting up new, wild combinations and possibilities.
