title: Ambition can limit possibility by freezing desire and direction
---
We can only define our 'ambition' by looking towards what we can presently imagine. Does this mean that ambition actually limits us, in that it can only guide us towards what we can contemplate as possible in a particular moment? (Does creating a path for ourselves mean that we don't explore the forest?)

This is a counterpoint to the common wisdom and pressure to have strong goals or a clear [[vision]] to work towards. But does that mean we should give up on 'ambition' or goal-setting? Perhaps a better way to consider ambition is to be guided by a set of values and qualities. For example, to [[make decisions based on what will ‘enlarge’ us over what makes us happy]] - this is ambitious in pushing us beyond our current state, but it doesn’t tie us to a particular course of action.
