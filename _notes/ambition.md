title: A note on ambition
---
Ambition in the traditional sense seizes on what we can contemplate as possible in a particular moment: we can only be ‘ambitious’ towards those things we can presently imagine. 

There is often pressure to have a set of clear goals and plans to work towards. Otherwise, how will you achieve success? But this view of ambition shines a light on its limits, and how creating a path for ourselves may mean that we don’t explore the forest. 

A better way to approach ambition is to be guided by a set of values and qualities. For example, to [[Make decisions based on what will ‘enlarge’ us over what makes us happy]] - this is ambitious in pushing us beyond our current state, but it doesn’t tie us to a particular course of action.
