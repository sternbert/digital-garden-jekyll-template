# The taste gap

When starting on creative work (or [any work, really](Even%20the%20best%20job%20won't%20be%20enjoyable%20all%20the%20time.md)), there will be a period of time - potentially quite a long time - where you will not be very good. In fact, you might be very bad. 
The problem is that the *impetus* for you getting into that creative work - say, an appreciation for great writing or a love of music - means that you will have probably developed good taste for that thing. Your standards are high. You recognise what works, what is beautiful, and what is original. 
So of course, when *you* start creating, you will recognise when your work [sucks](https://blog.charlietrochlil.com/sucking):

> There is always a gap between being an apprentice and being a craftsman. The apprentice has the taste, but not the skill. The craftsman has the taste and the skill. - [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/ira-glass-failure) 

You’re not going to pump out a fantastically written novel or concerto the first time you sit down to do it. The problem is, because you’ve honed this great taste, you will be able to recognise that what you’ve done is crap. And that’s discouraging. It will make you want to give up, because the thing you are creating will not meet your own taste. 

But you need to persevere. That taste that you’ve developed can be what stops you, or it can be what pushes you forward and drives you to improve. Otherwise, this taste gap can be what stops you ([[Most people say "I can't" to protect them from failure]]).

Perhaps that’s where habits come in. Deadlines. A focus on producing - not so much for the output, but just for the act of sitting down and showing up, time and time again (“Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions” - Elizabeth King).
