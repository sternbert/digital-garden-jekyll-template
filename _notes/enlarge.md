title: Make decisions based on what will ‘enlarge’ us over what makes us happy
---

> When stumped by a life choice, **choose “enlargement” over happiness.** I’m indebted to the Jungian therapist James Hollis for the insight that major personal decisions should be made not by asking, “Will this make me happy?”, but “**Will this choice enlarge me or diminish me?**” We’re terrible at predicting what will make us happy: the question swiftly gets bogged down in our narrow preferences for security and control. But the enlargement question elicits a deeper, intuitive response. You tend to just know whether, say, leaving or remaining in a relationship or a job, though it might bring short-term comfort, would mean cheating yourself of growth.
