# How to do what you love
* The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for itâ€”even if they had to work at another job to make a living. How many corporate lawyers would do their current work if they had to do it for free, in their spare time, and take day jobs as waiters to support themselves?
* One has to make a living, and it's hard to get paid for doing work you love. There are two routes to that destination: ^cb0960
	* The organic route: as you become more eminent, gradually to increase the parts of your job that you like at the expense of those you don't.  
	* The two-job route: to work at things you don't like to get money to work on things you do.
