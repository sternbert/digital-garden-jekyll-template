# Make decisions based on what will ‘enlarge’ us over what makes us happy

* When stumped by a life choice, **choose “enlargement” over happiness.** 
* Major personal decisions should be made not by asking, “Will this make me happy?”, but “**Will this choice enlarge me or diminish me?**”

* But the enlargement question elicits a deeper, intuitive response. You tend to just know whether, say, leaving or remaining in a relationship or a job, though it might bring short-term comfort, would mean cheating yourself of growth.
