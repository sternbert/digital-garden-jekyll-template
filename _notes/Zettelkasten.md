# Zettelkasten

* Atomic - one idea per note
* Emphasis on linking
* Don't just copy text. Put things into your own words. Paraphrase and rewrite.
* The note title itself can contain the idea within the note - when coming up with a title, consider "Would I get the central idea of the note without opening it?"
