title: What is a digital garden?

I think of digital gardens as akin to a ‘choose your own adventure’ of knowledge and ideas. Instead of reading chronologically or in a pre-defined order, a digital garden invites interaction and exploration by the user, and different journeys and destinations with each use. 

Digital gardens seem to live quite harmoniously with the [[Zettelkasten]] system of note-taking and personal knowledge management, built on atomic notes with interconnections, rather than polished articles arranged chronologically or only relevant at a certain point in time.

Like a physical garden, the components of a thriving digital garden are alive: each seed / note / idea constantly grows and evolves. That could be through the gardener tending to it, or through the seeds intermingling  and sprouting up new, wild combinations and possibilities. 

## My motivations for starting a digital garden

* I want to remember what I read 
* I want to learn how to engage more deeply and critically with what I consume. I find that content often washes over me. I read a lot, listen to a lot, consume a lot, but what am I actually digesting? What’s sticking? 
* The public element contains an element of accountability and visibility. I find it motivating to see my notes ‘out there’, even if I am the only one who sees it! 
* It’s also a learning pathway in and of itself, to learn more about web development, markdown, note-taking.
* It's a mechnanism to build connections between ideas, and learn how to put things into my own words. Each idea may already exist separately in the world, but only my garden will have each of these seeds planted together. 
* Not just regurgitating facts or quotes, but forcing me to engage with the material. What do I make of it? What do I think about this? How might this be relevant to my own life? What do I believe? How does this affect / change what I think, value and believe?
