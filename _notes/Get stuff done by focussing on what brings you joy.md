# Get stuff done by focussing on what brings you joy
* Instead of focussing on the discipline of doing something (e.g. getting up at 5am, meditating, writing), focus on being disciplined about what brings you pleasure and joy.
* Doing things for the joy of doing them, rather than for the obligation, will make your life seem like a playground rather than a bootcamp.
* Ask yourself: what do I feel like doing? What would be fun for me? What's fun about this? 
>...instead of being disciplined about hating on yourself to get things done, try being disciplined about remaining close to what brings you joy.
