Consolations by David Whyte -
> It may be that time away from a work, an idea of ourselves, or a committed partner, is the very essence of appreciation for the otherâ€¦ to live something that feels like a choice again, to find ourselves alone as a looked-for achievement, not a state to which we have been condemned. (p. 7) 


> The permeability of being alone asks us to re-imagine ourselves, to become impatient with ourselves, to tire of the same old story, and then slowly, hour by hour, to start to tell the story in a different way. (p.4)
